harm done by these new sects is incalculable. They assert that their
members go to Heaven without passing through Purgatory.

“Woe unto you who devour widow’s housesl’' The religious
Orders in our time are guilty os this. The monks os to·day are like
the lascivious elders who lusted alter the chaste Susanna. Covered by
alalse seeming ol holinesS, our priests bave criminal relations with
women, especially with such as are separated stom their husbands. The
custom lor women to keep a confessor in their husbands’ absence has
almost passed into a rule. And what shall we say ol the widows and
uuus whom such consessors lead astray? Thither tend all those pro-

tracted conversations with servants and maids during Mass, and the in·

cense burnt in women's apartments, as il there was a portion ol the
Deity hidden therein, and those brotherly gilts, or rather love-tokenS, ¹
which they exchange with women¹ - This is very like the portrait ol
the monk Hubert, taken [rom Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales²

Ol what use can the letters of fraternity -· a heretical contri-
vance - and the prayers os such men be to any one? Those sects are
ol the devil. As be beguiled Eve os old, so they now beguile gentle-
lolk os both sexes; the Pope upholds them, and they stand up sor him.
And sor that very reason they are against men following the Order ol
Christ: their Orders would soon be known to baveno foundation in
God’s law; they have crept in by a side door, like thieves and robbers,
as Scripture says. The endowed Orders and the begging friars are both
in the same category. They both try to get the possessions ol the laity:
instead ol living in marriage, according to the rule of (lhrist's Order,
they lock themselves up in themonasteries ol a sect which is not based
on Scripture; and, like the Mendicant Friars, they sin with widows. All
this because the Order ol Christ is made os no account, and the com·
mands os Antichrist are oheyed by all.

“Woe unto you who compass sea andland to make one proselyte,
and when ye have him, ye make him a child os bell twice as wicked
as yourselvesl'‘ Such are the (ardinals and liishops instituted by the

this subject at the eud of the tath chapter ol' De Antichristo, Rook lll.
