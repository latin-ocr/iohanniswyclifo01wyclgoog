“They love the first places in 103313, and in the schools, and to
be saluted in the market-place.” The Pope blasphemously commands all
to 0311 him “Holy Father”, whilst his rule should be, that he alone is
the highest who is the humblest. By this pride of the clergy, the Church
comes to grief. The Pope even declares that he stands in Christ’s stead
on earth; a salsehood which 1131103 the Church more than anything
etse.2 He is 30 hardened in his pride, that were Christ to return to
earth as 3 0130, he would not 3111101 him to sit by his side.³

“Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees! who close the kingdom
ol Heaven against man.” This is done by the Pope and his lellows, the
Scribes and Pharisees ol our days. 'l‘hey themselves cannot enter the

prophet says: “God will take away 11010 131301 head and tail, branch
and trunk in one clay,’' he means the Pope ol Rome by the head, ἵ
