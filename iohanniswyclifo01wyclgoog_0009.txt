VI lNTRODUCTlON.

The word Antichrist has sor Wyclil a very wide signification.

According to him, every man whose teaching and whose manner ol
living are contrary to Jesus Christ, is Antichrist. 'lhe Pope - that is,
not one Pope in particular, but the Papacy in general —has laboured under

. this opposition to Christ, ever since it became Caesarian and worldly by

its secular possessione and temporal power. How little Millenarian ideas
and tendencies inlluenced our author may be seen by the lact that,
though be admits that Antichrist has reigned ever since Constantine and
Pope Sylvester, he does not think that the end ol the world is near,
but believes this state ol things to be transient, a passing stage in the
development ol the Charch, which, as it existed centuries belore Anti·
christ, will also outlive him in the future. Still l will not deny that the
Western Schism made a considerable impression upon Wyclil. lt is even
demonstrated that he began to disseminate and to establish his doctrine
concerning Antichrist alter 1378, till he set it lorth sully developed
in the present work, afterwards in the unsparing language ol his tract
“De Christo et suo adversario Antichristo,” and lastly, though not at
great length, in his exposition ol the Gospel ol St. MattheW.

There are some allusions to this doctrine in his work, De Ecclesia
(1378).ι ln De Officio Regis (1379), he calls the Pope a pseudo-Christ,
unnecessary sor the governrnent ol the Church.² ln his Dialogus (1379)
and previously in his Dc Officio Pastorali (1378) he inveighs against
censores, indulgences‚ and bulls ol Antichrist.³ ln the Dialogus, he
says: “Why should the lall ol the Papacy be lamented? this institution
only breeds continual quarrels and conllicts concerning secular power.
lt is not even named in the Bible; so it is evidently an invention ol
Imperial policy in the time ol Antichrist.” And in his Sermones he
identifies the Papacy with Antichrist.⁴ In De Eucharistia, he calls
papal law the law ol Antichrist.⁶ ln De Blaspliemia (1381), he speaks
