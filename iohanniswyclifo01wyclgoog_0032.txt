Protestationes which John Hus, Jacob of Mies, Simon of Tisnow, Prokop
of Pilsen, Zdislaus of Zwierzeticz, and John of Giezin publicly made in
their famous defence of Wyclif s works, on July the εγὼ, 28²³, 29ἰΙΙ and
31⁸¹, and August the 6²¹¹ 1410, in presence of the numerous professore
and students of the University. The first of them says: Inprimis protestor
quod nec iam nec in posterum intendo aliquid pertinaciter dicere vel
defendere contra Dei legem &c

The second runs thus: Ne ergo ex defectu mee protestacionis in
me aliquam accipiant scandali occasionem, publice protestor quod in
nullo meo actu preterito, presenti, ac futuro, intendebam nec intendo
pertinaciter ex animo aliquid aperire et defendere quod est contra frdem . .‚

All the olher declarations are similar to these.¹ The above-mentioned
defenders of Wyclif gave lectores, copies of which were afterwards pu·
blicly distributed, and called Opera Magistralia. It was essential that
such publications should not be without a declaration of the sort; and
the presence of such a declaration in Shirley’s Ν0 44 proves it to be
the opus ›nagistrale referred to; whereaS, Νο 43 being without any such
declaration, we are justified in setting it aside as a mere excerpt from
De Antichristo 1, ch. 111 and seq.

lnShirley’s N⁰ 44 the Protestatio is as follows: Omnia autem prius
exposita sunt tamquam dicta probabiliter capienda, protestando quodsi
aliqua persona ecclesie docuerit sensum magis probabilem, volumus illi
humiliter consentire. ..

Wyclif s declarations of faith, terse and to the point, were very
popular; they were subsequently collected and edited together.² We must
however, remark that their value is merely that which belongs to a for-
mality; they give no proof either for or against Wyclif' s orthodoxy, and
it would be mere folly to draw thence any inferences as to our author’s
character.

lt is regrettable that, misled by Shirley’s notice, l did not take
this tract in hand at an earlier date. lt is not advisable to prepare it
for press now, at the eleventh honr, for that would retard the publi·

cation os the present work for a whole year. We shall have to publish
it amongst the Miscellanea.
