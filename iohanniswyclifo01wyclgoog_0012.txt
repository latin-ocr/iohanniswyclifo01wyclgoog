INTRODUCTlON. ll(

was always a model ol poverty in His lise; the Pope thinks it glorious
to be the richest manin the world. Christ was meekness itsels, the
Pope is most arrogant, cruel and revengesul; not having all the power
he desires, he scatters anathemas abroad, and grants indulgences to all
such as revenge him on his enemy the anti-pope: ol which the Crusade
is a recent prool. Can a greater contrast be conceived than that be-
ween Christ and the Pope? Christ gives bis lile lor bis enemies3 the

Pope sacrifices the lives of many Christians, in order to keep that

temporal power ol which the possession is against God’s law!

Whereas Christ lorbids us most severely to set up any laws in
opposition to His, the Pope promulgates many anti-scriptural edicts, aud
punishes those who disobey them more than the transgressurs os God's
commandments; aS, sor instance, in bis behaviour to the cardinals.¹ Is
Christ came to save suuls, and the Pope continually destroys them, is
he not Antichrist? ⁴

Christ sent His disciples out into the world. Antichrist does the
rei·erse; he lives in superb palaces, built with the money ol the poor,
or llees by night stum placeto place like a thiel, nut daring to raise
his head because ol his enemies. He gives his disciples consor-table
dwellings in the Patrimony of the Crucified; he does not send forth his
monkS, but locks them up, lest they should preach. Each ol them, like
another (beroea, lives in his castle, the une in Avignon, the other in
Rome3 neither ol them caring about the Gospel. ls that to follow Christ?

Jesus hates all worldly power; Antichrist sets himself abore any,
and by the aid olbis accompliceS, the monks ul the various Orders, he
rules orer all countrieS.

Christ obeyed the Emperor, und had no desire ol secular dominion,
either lor Himsell or lor His disciplcs3 He was no burden tu the secular
lords, nor to their vassals: in all this the Pope does the contrary. lle
has stolen not less than one hall ul the Roman Empire. Neithcr Christ
nur llis disciples would have accepted such power; yet the Pope does
all to increase the inlluence ol the clergy and decresse that os the laity.
