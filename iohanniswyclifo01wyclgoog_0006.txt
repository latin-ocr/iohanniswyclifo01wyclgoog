t Antichrist in Wyclii's previous works.

The treatise which lies before us was never completed. In the
Prelace to the Opus Evangelicum, Wyclil says that three considerable
groups oi passages in Scriptum, namely Matth. v-vll, XXlll—XXV,

course without either hesitancy or deviation3 that he all along addressetl
