os the school ol Antichrist, its excommunications and tyrannical censures3
in De Aposlasia and the Trialogus (1383) the Pope is identified with
Antichrist; also in short tracts that date irom the last years oi Wyclil's·
Ιίἱε.Ι 'l‘hus it is no matter ior surprise that De Antichristo should have
been written; it should rather surprise us that he did not give this title
to one os his earlier worlrs; ior instance, to De Poiesiaie Papam lor
we find therein sentences that are almost word lor word the same as
others in De Antichristo The Pope, to deserve his title, should imi·
tate Christ in lise and doctrine; as he does just the reverse, he is Anti·
christ² All that is written ol him is quite applicable to the Pope. Christ
is truth, the Pope a lie; Christ is poor, the pope is rich; Christ is
meek and gentle, the Pope proud, revengeiul and cruel. And so on.
When, in Ch. VIII, he deals with the problem: ls the Pope necessary
to the Church? it is quite clear lrom Ch. XI that the whole tractate
exists only ior the sake ol answering the following question: What the
character oi a true Pope is, and what the character ol a modern Pope.
Such passages are osten to be met with in Wyelil's latest works. But·
we shall give no more quotations lrom them, and will now turn to the
book which has come down to us with the title &Antichristo

nobis occiduis precipuus Antichristus. ²Quicumque est Christo vel legi suae
contrarius, dicitur Antichristus, ab anti, quod est contra, et Christus,- quasi contra
Christum. — This tractate also was written during the schism, as we see by the
remark: Dicentibus se hodie papas ⁴ Et comperto quod pastores isti spohistici
sunt taliter Antichristus, tunc sunt tamquam diaboli detestandi, quia episcopus sni-
