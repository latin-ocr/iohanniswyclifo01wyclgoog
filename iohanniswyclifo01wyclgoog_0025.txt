ii the Popes do not answer satisfactorily on these points, they should
both be shunned as heretics.¹

From this we may draw practical conclusions as to our duties lor
the present² Nn nation is obliged to transact business with either ol ⁴
the Popes' courts at its own expense. No clerk should be admitted into
England by order ol aPope, until the latter has spoken ont and justified
his laith. The higher clergy would be judges ol this, and the poor
priests would have only to set forth what the true laith is, and then to
seek the greater welsare ol their country. The secular rulers’ duty is
to put down all abuses in the Church, and the duty oi priests is to
