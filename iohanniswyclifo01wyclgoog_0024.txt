lNTRODUCTlON. XXI

According to this principle, no collector of money for the Pope
should be suffered in this country; according tu this principle, the
King's privy council’s duty is to deliver the Kingdom from such tyranny,
to imprison the collectors, and keep them in prison until the King’s
faithful clerks - Nicolas Hereford, for example — have been set free
by the Pope. But the Kings and secular lords either are indifferent to
this tyranny of Antichrist, or else they are his accomplices One of the
worst heresies of Antichrist is the doctrine of 'l‘ransubstantiatiom it is
the point on which all his pride rests. Wyclif accordingly avails himself
of the occasion to speak about it at length.¹ But not only is this doc-
trinea heresy; we ftnd'heresies in plenty elsewhere. Take the question:
Which of the two popes is in the right? One of the two must surely
be a hereticis not Urban VI considered a heretic in France, and
Clement VII in England? Ecen in one and the very same country,
opinions are divided. Here in England a certain Friar, famous for his
literary attainments (would he were so good a theologinnl) considers
the antipope Clement Vll to be the true one. Does not he, with all his
followers stand in danger of damnationi As for us, says Wyclif, we
are of opinion that, both being opposed to Christ, they are both heretics,

though each of them claims to be His supreme vicegerent upon earth.²

Both of them should he put to a test.³ Let not their claims be
acknowledged until they have proved the soundness of their faith on
the three following points. 1rst as to the doctrine of the Holy Sacrament;
2¹¹d as to the voluntary poverty of the clergy, who should renounce

their possessions3 and 3¹⁶ as to a complete return to Christ's pure and
immaculate doctrine, which would imply the suppression of all the
recently established Sects’ (or Orders’) unwarrantable revendications. And

¹ We may dispense with the atialysis ol this passage; it brings forward the same
vieivs as have already been dealt with in the Introduction to De Eucharistia.
²Quidam frater magne literature — utinam prudencie theologice - dicitur nunc
in anglia publicare quod Urbanus noster VI non est papa, sed Clemens sibi con·
trarius . . . Videtur quod alter istorum sit manifestus hereticus, non solum propter
repugnancium in papatus officio, sed quia peccat in heresi de hostia consecrata, et
quia non sequitur in pauperie dominum lesum Christum... ³ Foret medium
empiricum neutrum suscipere tanquam papam.
