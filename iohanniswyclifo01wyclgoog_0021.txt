XVI lNTRODUCTlON.

There can, therefore, be no doubt that the Pope is the Antichrist men·
tioued in so many passages ol Scripture. Troe, the devil attempts to
darken this nuth, and says: “Does the Pope uproot trees? does he
make them bear blossoms on their roots? does he sweep through the
air on a chariot drawn by steeds oi lire? or has he even countless
,treasures hidden in any place? all which things are distinctive os Anti-
christ.” Now it would be easy, by a mystical interpretation of Scripture,
to show how llimsy these objections ο1 Satan are; but it is by no means
necessary to try that way ο1 answering. l, who am so much suspected
ol heresy‚ maintain the obvious meaning os Scripture; and 1 say: livery
person who publicly sets himseli up against Christ is Antichrist¹ Such
is the Pope - not one single Person, as ior instance, the present
Pope »— but all Popes since the endowment os the Church, all Car·
dinals and Bishops, and all their accomplices, Antichrist is thus a mon·

strous composite personality.⁹ There may even have been saints amongst

the number, as, v. g. Gregory, who perhaps repented sincerely at the
end ο1 his lise. Such a thing is possible, but not an article os saith.3
Laymen too may be companions ο1 Antichrist⁴ -· What are the outward
and visible signs ο1 Antichrist? This is a point upon which Wyclii
likes to dweil, and he mentions it in many ο1 his works. The srrst sign
is as follows: Christ was the humblest, the poorest, the most obedient
oi men. Who can say that ol the Pope?⁵ Does he not take most cruel
reveoge upon his enemies? Does he not bring all his deeds, all his
thoughts to bear upon the acquisition of worldly power and inlluence?
And does he obediently follow God's law as set down in Scripture? As
he always does exactly the reverse, he is Antichrist more than all
