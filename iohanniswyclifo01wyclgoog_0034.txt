INTRODUCTION. XXXI

the Acts of Gregory XI, nor in that of Urban VI. (which has come down
to us only in fragments, and in which the most important data to usare
wanting) is Wyclif even mentioned. In more than a hundred documents
there are references to the English sources of the Pope’s revenue,
and very numerous orders issued to collectors and subcollectors.
Knowing what Wyclif’s views were concerning the Pope's frnancial
management, and especially concerning his conduct in that respect, we
may expect to lind in those documents directions to prelates how to
meet his attacks. Yet eren the five bulls are nowhere to be found in the
Vatican Register, while we find there contemporaneous records regar·
ding the same country.

A study of the bulls may tuing us to infer that Gregory XI was
hostile to Wyclif s system: but we may safely say, on the basis afforded
by the documents of the Vatican, that this hostility had no secondary
purpose in view. No pope was more zealousto preserve the integrity of
Church doctrine than was Gregory XI. Whilst he opposed Wyclifrsm in
England, he exerted all his authority against the Bohemian Milicz of
Kremsier,¹ and set himself against Sachscnspiegcl in Germany2, against
heresy in Venaissin and elsewhere. One document, written by an inqui·
sitor of that time, contains principles that would do credit to our thth

century feelings uf liumauity'.³ But I shall, I hope, find means to employ
elsewhere the materials l found in Rome relative to the Reform in

En land.

g 'l‘he date of De .·lntichristo has already been fixed by what has
been said. Wyclif died about the close of the year 1384, without having
cumpleted this treatise. In some places, 1384 is alluded to as the time

at which he writcs3⁴ in others, he mentions occurrences which took
place in that year.⁵
