INTRODUCTlON. V

repeatedly says that in his opinion the Papacy must infallibly be shat-
tered one day.

ln the two latter books, still more than in the former, Wyclil is
taken up by the notion that the Pope is identical with Antichrist, and
indeed he at first gave them the title “lle Antichristo''.

Worlrs with this title, as is well known, appeared almost as
soon aa Christianity itsels. Most os thern belong to the Millenarian type,
and were most popularia the times of that heresy. Wyclil’s doctrine
cannot be said to resemble it in the least. He mentions indeed, not
without respect, the names ol Joachim de Floris,' but he rejects with
contempt all prophecies as to the approaching end ol the world, and
blames the ioiiy oi those who engage in such fruitless enquiries. The time
ol the Day oi Judgrnent is a point on which God has chosen to leave
us in ignorance. lle also puts but little laith in propheta and prophecies
since the Christian era, and rebukes the Abbot loachim with having
given way to auch weakness.² lt is well that we are ignorant ol such
matters, because we are thus excited to greater vigilance. Wyclil‘s mind
was by lar too much taken up with the Scriptores to allow himself to
go beyond their sure foundation. He does not even conceive Antichrist
as a lixed personality; a contemporary os the Emperor Fredericlr ll

called Pope innocent lV by that name; the Bohemian Milicz,⁸ in a public
discourse‚ called the Emperor Charles lV Antichrist: Wyclif avoids this,
and stands quite alool lrom the fancilul notions attached to this word

by the vulgar, and which were prevalent at that time.⁴

lile names him as a victim ol innocent lll’s intolerance: contra abbatem
loachim et alios irreligiose processit (De Eucharistia. pag. 278). ²Ex fide
sumus certissimi quod ternpore suo est dies iudicii; sed quando et quarn distanter
