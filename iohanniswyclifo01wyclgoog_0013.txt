lNTRODUCTlON.

Christ chose as his instruments poor, simple-minded, ignorant folk;
the Pope surrounds himself with more than 12 CardinalS, the most cele·
brated and elever men he can fmd; and those who have the greatest
power according to the world are made by him lords over Rome and
the world (urbis et orbis).

Christ forbade His disciples to take the sword,· the pope, as a
declarcd Antichrist‚ wages dreadful wars, sending his messengers into
all countries‚ not to preach religion, but to increase his power. ¹Christ
humbly came to John, asking to be baptized by'him: the Pope summons
men from the uttermost ends of the earth to his tribunal. Christ shows
to those whom He calls, the way of salvation; the Pope threatens them
with the pains of Hell. Jesus came to Jerusalem, poor and lowly, riding
on an ass; the Pope keeps a gorgeous court, which is a heavy burden
on all meu.¹ Christ washed llis disciples’ feet in all humility3 the Pope
exacts that the Emperor should lead his horse, and the faithful must
’ bow down and kiss his feet. Scripture says; Freely ye have received,
freely give; but nothing is to be had at the Pope's court without pay·
ment. No one may rebuke the Pope; he has all laws in the will of his
beart, gives dispensations as he chooseS, and thinks it a more grievous
sin to trespass against his laws than against those of God. ,

“Such'’ says Wyclif, “are the characters of Antichrist. 1 have
set them together here, that every Christian may shun him; for our

religion reaches us that none is obliged to ohey the Pope, except in
so far as he imitates Christ.” ⁸

b) The tractate De Antichristo and its contents.

At the outset of his exposition of the Gospel of the St. Matthew‚
Wyclif follows step by step the commentary known as that of Chry-
sostom, which he preferred, for the reason that Father’s philosophical
tendcncies were akin to his own.¹ Chrysostom shows how hard it is to
