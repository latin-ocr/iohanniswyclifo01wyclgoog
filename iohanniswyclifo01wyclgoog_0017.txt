Roman Curia.¹ The Pope doesnotchoose 1113333313, but mighty men
01 war; not poor priests who follow Christ, but sons 01 great lordS, and
Royal 3131113, 13 order to win them over to their side. But the monks
too strive to draw men into their 33313, and to withdraw them from
imitating Christ, saying that their sect is better than His.

“Woc unto you, you blind guideS, who say: Whoso swears by
the temple, it is nothing; but whoso swears by the gold in the temple,
he is a debtor.'’ Asin the days 01 133 old Covenant, so now, these
words aim at those among the clergy who are possessed by greed and
cupidity. What has once been given to them, they call a thing sanctihed,
and to take it 13013 the s0·ealled Church is the most awsul sacrilege.
'l‘hus lands may 33 given to the Church, but never taken 11013 11; 3311

accumulation causes wars to be made and conquests to cnsue. liven

must lie taken away, even 33 133 13131113 13 Jerusalem was robhed and
despoiled. Church property is not needed, nor arc the new laws 01 the
sto-called Church required, nor is the hierarchy a necessary thing. Werc
the Pope and all his Cardinals to die or 33 deposed, the Church would

be better, not worse oli 11133 3013.3 What are the Bishop’s ‹luticsi 'l'o
give confirmation, to consecrate the holy 0113, and to ordain priests. That

may be done by every true priest. Christ Himsels received no such
unction.⁴

“Woe unto you, who make a duty 01 133 slightest things, and neglect
the weightiest: justice, mercy and laith.'’ Such is the conduct 01 our
parish priests, who care more 103 their tithes than sor the things 01
God. From the Pope downwards, all, even to the lowest clerk, think
more 01 their income than 01 1113 30313 01 13313 congregation.⁵ That is
