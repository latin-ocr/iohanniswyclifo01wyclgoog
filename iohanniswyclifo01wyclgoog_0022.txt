INTRODUCTION. XIX

“When ye see the abomination of desolation (let him who readeth
mark it well).” This text, says Wyclif, may be rendered somewbat
obscure by Satan’s cunning, yet its meaning can be found out, since
Christ Himself commando us to find it. Here an interpretationis necesssary,
and a good interpretation has as much value as a prophecy.¹ Nune of
the commentators on this Gospel has caught the true meaning of the
text; yet there can be no doubt that by the abomination of desolation
Christ means the Ρορε,2 because he is the source of all evil. He is tlte
abomination of desolation (an abstract quality), because, inveterate in evil,
he has become hardened even to fiendish perversity. This abomination
of desolation may be known by many visible signs.³ lle sits in the holy

place ; i. e., he arrogares supreme authority to himself, saying, not only
that he can do all that Christ did, but that he can do what Christ could
⁸ not,· for He never could have led such a life.⁴ But that is mere pride,

and the highest degree of depravity. Wyclif then proceeds to enumerate
the outward signs by which Antichrist may be known. They are eight,
and all show the Pope in the strongest contrast to Christ.l

1. Christ was most humble and extremely poor. The Pope is the
most arrogant of men, and most grecdy of power.

2. Christ was a help (allevians) to the Church; the Pope, both in
himself and in his adherents‚ is its greatest burden.

3. Christ eschewed all worldly possesions; the Pope is no longer
a shepherd, but, like a blind mole, he teaches us to love things temporal,
both by bis own example and that of others.

4. Chn‘st journeyed on foot throughout the land, relieving the
oppressed, and healing the sick; the Pope, like another cosroes. resides
in a superb palace, built with the sweat of poor men’s brows - and
he oppresses the poor.

5. Christ gave all grace freely to men; the Pope sells every
spiritual comfort, and thus proves himself guilty of simony.

²Christus intelligit per hec verbu Papam sive Romanum pontificem. ’Her
abominacio habuit multa signa . . . ⁴ (Papa) innuit se non solum facere omnin
que Christus potuit, sed multa qne Christus non potuit. ⁶ R. 133, 134. Cf. De
