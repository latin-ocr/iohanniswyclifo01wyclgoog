outside 01 which there is 30 salvation. It includes the Church triumphant,
militant, and sufferiug; saints in Heaven, men ou earth, aud souls in
purgatory. Each part of this one Church has 3 33033313 unity in itself.
This unity is destroyed by the Four Orders, who have brought the
devii into the Church. Was St„ Peter its Head? No: only Christ was,
and is, that. All His disciples have the same power. lt is blasphemy
to say that the Popes are the heads 01 the Church militant3 some 01
them were notoriously devils; aud as to making them the heads 01 the
Church triumphant, we might as well assert that they rule over the
augels. The power which the Popes possess, given 1ο them by the Em·
perors‚ has no foundatIon in' Holy Writ. The miserable condition 01 the
Church, the schism, the deplorable state of the clergy, the wordliness
01 the Papacy, the Papal electious, in open contradiction with the rules
given iu Scripture, 311 prove that the Church might exist without the
Pope. As it would be advantageous to the Church if the Pope followed
Christ both in life and doctrine, so it is hurtful to it to have a Pope
who from both these standpoints is their opposite, and therefore Anti-
christ. Jesus Christ stands out in opposition to them as the true Shep-
herd of our souls.¹ 'rhe Church can 33131 perfectly well without a Pope,
as was the case from the time of Christ’s ascension to that 01 the en·
dowment of the Church. This papal presumption has caused the Church
to decresse iu number, and doctrines 01 devils to be introduced therein.
Itis at present 3 dogma that uo Pope can possibly err, either In 1113
03 doctrine, 10311 13 held as a rule 01131111 that all he decides is 10
be believed. Thence we find all those numberless privileges, indulgences,
and excommunications, respected under pain 01 damnati0n; whereas,
every pope is fallible, aud some were men 01 sinsul lives. How can
an adversary 01 Christ be the Head 01 the Church?

He is contrary to Christ in twelve points. Christ is the truth, the
Pope bases his power on a lie. His words, his writings and his lile are
all a Ιί3; for, calIIng himself the Vicat 01 Christ, his life is in absolute

contradiction to Ilim. In his writings, bulls and DecretaIS, he craves

103 mundane glory, whilst the Guspel bids usto renounce it. Christ
