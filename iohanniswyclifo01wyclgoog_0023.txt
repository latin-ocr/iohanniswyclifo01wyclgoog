XX lNTRODUCTlON.

ὁ. Christ taught that the Gospel should be preached to all freely;
the Pope says, in his bulls (which have no Scripture warrant) that the
people are to hear only what he chooses.

7. Christ instructs us to shun earthly honour and lucre; the Pope
orders us to do the reverse.

8. Christ was ever true and faithful in His promises; the l'ope,
in his, has no end but lying and deceit.

All this necessarily proves that the Pope is Antichrist¹ Christ
taught His Church only things useful, needful, and according to reason;
the Pope teaches many things false, unnecessary, and without any rea·
sonable foundation. It is only ironically that he may be called “Holy
Father”; the holy place where he dwells is a nest of diabolical simony,
full of lies and deceit.² Other signs by which Antichrist will be known,
are mentioned in the Bible; they all suit the Pope. By giving privileges
which imply a falsehood, and therefore could nothe granted even by
God, he exalts himself above God. He sets himself up as the highest
judge in earthly matters, whereas Christ said: “0 man, who made me
a judge amongst you?'’ He makes laws which contradict the laws of God;
he seeks his own farne and profit. What else is aimed at by his unjust
claims to crown the Emperor, to bestow bishoprics and other dignities,

and to grant privileges and indulgencesl³ No Pope, no Christian, is to

be obeyed, except in so far as his commands are identical with those
of Christ. Therefore examine the spirit of their laws, whether or no it
proceeds from God; if not, let Bishop, Cardinal or Pope command, he
should not be obeyed.⁴ Such a rule would soon deliver us from Anti·
christ’s follies,'his indulgences and absolutioris. We are ready to obey,
hut only if it be proved that the Pope acts according to Christ’s orders,⁵
