XXX INTRODUCTION.

3. The transmission of the MSS; their date; and
concluding remarks.

Both the MSS. (Cam. B. 16. 2 [A]‚ and Dubl. C. 1. 23) which
contain the tractate De Antichristo have already been fully described in
Sermones 1. p. XXXV, De Ecclesia pp. XXII-XXIV, and op. Ev. I, p. V.
In the first volume oi the Sermones is given a passage in the hand·
writing ol Α, and also one in that ol Β. As to Nos. 43 and 44 ol Shir-
ley’s catalogue, l will mention that both these tracts are to be found in the
Prague MSS. N. H. 7. Some future editor may profit by this remark.

Ihoped to succeed in finding hitherto unknown historical data
concernIng the conflict ol Wyclil with the Papacy between 1378 and
1384. 'l‘here are many allusions in Wyclil's works which seem to show
that the Pope's efforts were not limited solely to the slve bulls promul·

gated against him by Gregory XI, on May the 22nd 1377, lrom Santa Maria

Maggiore3 and in one oi Wyclii ’s writings,‚l have, l believe, discovered that
he complains of having been unjustly treated by the Pope. ¹ 'rue whole affair is
somewhat obscure, and is not cleared up by any ol his subsequent works. It
has relerence to an event in his life concerning which we have uo other
data. According to him, the Pope had deprived him ol a benefice in
Lincoln, to give it to a young foreigner. This lact, however, can by no
means be assigned as the reason ol the passionate bitterness from which he
never can relrain when speaking ol Pope Gregory; nor do the contents
ol those bulls Ihave mentioned suffice to account sor his animosity.l
accordingly travelled to Rome, to sind out the cause ol his hatred in the
archives ol the Vatican, now so liberally thrown open to the public. But
though I received the most friendly assistance that I could expect srom
Director Denille, all my investigations on that point proved fruitless. The
bulls oi Pope Juhn XXIII of February the 22¹¹d, in which he lorbids
Wyclif's books to be read and commands them to bc burnt,² are the
only documents which have been preserved, or rather which Ι was
able to find about Wyclil in the Vatican archives. Neither in the index to
