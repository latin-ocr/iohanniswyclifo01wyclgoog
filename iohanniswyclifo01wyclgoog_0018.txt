why church dignities are to be got lor money. Provided the Pope finds
he can prosit by any ecclesiastical fonction, does he care who discharges
it?¹ And yet priests who do not lulfil the duties to which their olsrce
obliges them have no claim to tithes Rut who would dare publicly to
speak against such irregularities? His late would soon be that os John
the Baptist, when he reproved Herod lor his evil titel

“Woe unto you who make clean the outside ol the cup and plaster,
and within are lull os unrighteousness and uncleanncss” The text suits
our present clergy, who care more lor externals and things belonging
to their particular Order than sor God's law; they resemble whited sc·
pulchres‚ that look sair [rom outside‚ but within are filled with dead
men's bones, They build tombs to the prophets, and monuments over the
graves ol the righteous; but they act like those priests of the Old Cove-
nant‚ who were guilty os the prophets’ blood. Are not the “poor priests’'
who do but imitate Christ in word and deed, persecuted in lingland
even now?

At the 26ιιι chapter, Wyclil begins to comment on Matth. XXIV.
The disciples ol Christ were showing Him the Temple and its various
buildings. But He said: “Verily, not one stone shall remain upon another.”
And the destruction os the Temple shows us that Antichrist’s 'church will
also be destroyed.⁴

“Many will come in my name, saying: 1 am Christ, and they will
mislead many.'’ Here Wyclil uses the commentary ol St Jerome. This

Saim, he sayS, knew history well and Scripmre still better; and he
thought that Antichrist is that man, and that man alone, who sets him·
sell in Christ’s place. And this points to the Pope, whom twelve distinct
characteristics show to be Christ's adversary.⁵ lle pretends to be Christ's
Vicar upon earth, and seizes every occasion to lead the Church astray.

¹ Quomodo, rogo, iuste curat papa quis occupet huiusmodi dignitates, dum·
modo commodum temporale sibi accreverit? ² Sed quis auderet dicere in pub-
licum alia inconveniencia? . . . revera maiorem penam pateretur avocatis prelatis
ecclesie quam baptista ex arguicione adulterii passus luerat ab Herode. ³Pau-
peres presbyteros, qui tam vita quam verbis vitam Christi detegunt persequuntur.
